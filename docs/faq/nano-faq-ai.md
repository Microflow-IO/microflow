# ðŸ¤–Nano and AI

There is no doubt that Nano's high-quality cloud and cloud native fine-grained traffic logs can greatly improve the efficiency of AI analysis and are natural partners of various AI scenarios.

**1. AISEC**

- Detect potential threats more quickly and identify abnormal behaviors and security attacks;

- Establish a comprehensive security behavior model based on traffic patterns.

**2. AISECOPS**

- Significantly shorten accident response time and automate operation safety strategy;

- Provide historical traffic correlation analysis to accurately locate the root cause of the accident.


**3. AIOPS**

- Improve the performance and stability of the cloud environment through fault prediction and resource optimization;

- Monitor the microservice invocation chain and locate performance bottlenecks and resource exceptions.


**We are also conducting tests in this area. Experiments show that in some cases, Nano data can help us reduce data governance time by 60% and improve risk and fault location accuracy by 80%.**

**By the way, we plan to release our SecOps AI Agent in October 2025**.
